# Cinema-management-system

A CRUD app using Django as backend to implement a Cinema management system providing user 
the ability to view all the movies with time. And gives admin the ability to book seats,
add movies, delete movies, add and delete customers, and show which movie is being displayed
in which hall.

At the backend, it stores data in Mysql and uses a connector to communicate with the django app.

The frontend uses the django built in features of templates with helps us in writing less code,
and making it more efficient to write new pages.
